reverse engineering contents of Atmel EEPROM chip inside Mattel's Real Loving Baby Doll


### Intro
She can "talk" and "drink"...but what more can see do? The belly of the beast contains a [ATMEL AT24C04 EEPROM](http://www.atmel.com/images/doc0180.pdf) that we can read with [this Arduino Library](https://github.com/yazug/EEPROM24C04_16) (powered by 3.3 volt from a [Prolific PL2303](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?pcid=41&showlevel=0041-0041)).

### Dump
In this repo you find a ascii dump of the hex data on the chip. More to come...
